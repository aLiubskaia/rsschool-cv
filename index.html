                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I am a practicing graphic designer and photographer. For a long time I tried to get a job in the company’s staff as a designer, but several attempts were unsuccessful. Freelancing also requires me to constantly be a kind of marketer, which I don’t really want to do.
I came into development not only because of a desire to work full-time, but also because of an interest in UI/UX and a desire to write my own web application someday. It is common for me to unsuccessfully search for a service that is necessary and convenient for me, but there is no such thing or the existing ones have fatal flaws for me.
I have always enjoyed technical subjects at school and university, and I decided to devote myself again to something precise, but as creative as design.</p>
